Installation Process  

SmartGrow was initially developed as a web-based program, providing customers with two distinct options for installation and usage. The first approach entails a local installation, in which the application functions within a network environment that restricts access to devices linked within that network. 

The second method entails deploying the software onto a web server, which requires the following explanation of the deployment process. Using this configuration, users who have the necessary network infrastructure can remotely access the program through the internet, allowing for convenient usage from almost anywhere.

System requirements

*Operative system*

Smartgrow was designed to be compatible with any operating system that can open a web browser. Nevertheless, we strongly advise utilizing an Ubuntu operating system to facilitate the installation procedure. The interoperability and user-friendly interface of Ubuntu simplify the setup procedure, guaranteeing a more seamless experience for users.

*Software requirements*

To install and utilize Smartgrow, the user must fulfill the following software requirements:

1. Install and set up Docker Compose on your local PC or web server. We recommend that you follow Docker Compose's official installation and configuration guide for your operating system. Because installation procedures can vary over time, it is advisable to use the most recent documentation available at the time of installation. However, Appendix A of this user guide contains instructions for installing Docker Compose version 2.24.3 (which was used for testing) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Additionally, Appendix B contains instructions for installing the same version of Docker Compose on a Windows 11 operating system.
1. Install and configure Git (Appendix C).
1. If the user's operating system is Windows 11, they must additionally install and setup WSL 2. Appendix D of this user guide describes how to install WSL 2 on a Windows 11 operating system.

*Steps for Installation or Deployment*

1. Open Docker Desktop (only for Windows 11) and confirm that the Docker engine is operating. The user can confirm this by looking in the bottom left corner of the Docker Desktop window for a green indication with the phrase "Engine running," as illustrated in Figure 1.
